## This project is part of the Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree program. 
It's a website that showcases the projects I've build so far, using HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript and jQuery. This project however, uses server side Javascript, namely Node and Express JS.
The project consists of 3 pages: homepage, profile page and a page with dynamically changed content for each project selected.
The html templates are created with Pug JS and the data for display is stored in a JSON file.
The tasks of this project are:
- Import the required dependencies
- Link the JSON with the Pug templates
- Set up routes to handle requests
- Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
- Handle errors
- Set up a server to serve the project
