            | Hello there, I'm Biljana. I am a software engineering graduate, from the
            a(href='https://www.ihu.gr/' target="_blank")  ATEI
            |
            | university of Greece. Since 2016, I moved to Belgium where I still reside.
            | So far I have worked as a freelance front-end developer, mostly developing static websites and until February of 2020,
            | I worked, for 3 years, as Servicenow consultant and developer, in a company in Mechelen. When time came to part ways with my previous employer,
            | I decided to leave aside the Servicenow world and dedicate myself on broadening and gaining knowledge in web technologies and development.

            | In the previous months, I have followed an online program for full stack Javascript developer and gained a certificate in June.
            | The program included 10 projects, developed in vanilla Javascript, jQuery, React, Node JS, Express JS, SQLite with Sequelize JS for the last 3 projects and a final exam.
          p The projects you can find on this site, are part of the training I took online plus the websites I created some years ago, while working as a freelancer.
            | And since I created this website too, it can be included as part of my portfolio :) I implemented it with Node JS, Express JS and Pug.
          p
            | On the right, you can find the link to my Github profile, where I have the repositories for the projects I've implemented and my Linkedin profile, which I keep up-to-date.
          p
            | Thank you for visiting my website and being curious about my work :)
